# Unexpected Layout Behavior with CSS calc() in Flexbox

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS, particularly within flexbox containers. The problem arises from misinterpreting how `calc()` interacts with the content's size and the flexbox layout algorithm. The provided `bug.css` file showcases the problematic code. The solution, found in `bugSolution.css`, rectifies the issue and explains the necessary adjustments.

**Problem:** The `calc()` function does not always produce expected results if the element's size is not explicitly defined or is influenced by other factors like content size. This is particularly relevant within flexbox, where the default behavior can lead to incorrect calculations.

**Solution:**  To correctly use `calc()` in flexbox and similar contexts, you need to fully understand the layout context and ensure that the calculation is made with regard to available space, or using properties with reliable values like `min-content` or `max-content`.
